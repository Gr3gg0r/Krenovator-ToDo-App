# Todo App for Krenovator
 Simple to do list required for TSA Applications
 
## Two Build Version.
 If you look at the branch , we got two build one for web and the other for android.
 
### Why android?

Well i does not enable the ios features since in Malaysia here to be able develop for Mac os ecosystem is a luxury. Maybe if i can make a tons of money from development job i might consider moving towards apple ecosystem.

#### VM WARE , HACKINTOSH?

Well i try it , and it's not worth tho since super laggy and nested virtualization is actually a joke for now unless you run a very powerful pc and a very high performance server.

## Android Version

Well you could see the directory of Install Apk , navigate there and walla there's goes the APK file , install it on your device . No worries it is virus free , you can look at the proof url of virus total i placed inside the folder.

## Web Build

Do check this link [Krenovator To Do App](https://portfolio-34dfd.web.app/#/) . If you want to check the source code no worries it just same as the Android code one. Since Flutter is one platform for all kind of framework. However the web build is still in beta. So im sorry if the performance not living up to your expectation
